# Developer guide: getting your environment set up

1. Make sure you have both `node` and `yarn` installed.
   We recommend using `nvm` to manage your node versions.
2. sbb-angular uses Bazel which requires certain Bash and UNIX tools.
   - On Windows we recommend using WSL2. Please make sure firefox and google-chrome-stable is installed inside WSL.
     Otherwise you might encounter `wslpath` errors when running tests.
   - On Windows on SBB Managed Devices: Follow the guide to install on windows below, but install MSYS2 to `C:\devsbb\msys64`
     and add `.bazelrc` to your user directory (`C:\Users\{user}\.bazelrc`) with the following content:
     ```
     startup --output_user_root=C:/devsbb/bazel/out
     build --repository_cache=C:/devsbb/bazel/cache
     ```
   - On Windows: Follow the [instructions](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/install-windows.html#step-5-optional-install-compilers-and-language-runtimes)
     to install [`MSYS2`](https://www.msys2.org/) and the listed "Common MSYS2 packages".
     Afterwards add `C:\msys64\usr\bin` to the `PATH` environment variable.
   - On macOS: Create .bazelrc file in your home directory and add `test --experimental_inprocess_symlink_creation` and `build --experimental_inprocess_symlink_creation` on a second line.
     This avoids errors with Chromium as it currently contains spaces in the filename.
3. From the root of the project, run `yarn` to install the dependencies.

To build sbb-angular in release mode, run `yarn build packages`. The output can be found under `dist/releases`.

To bring up a local server, run `yarn start`. This will automatically watch for changes
and rebuild. The browser should refresh automatically when changes are made.

## Bazel

[Bazel](https://www.bazel.build/) is a build system. It allows incremental builds by caching build artifacts.

To install bazel globally, we recommend installing it with `yarn global add @bazel/bazelisk`, after
following the steps above. This will add `bazel` and `bazelisk` to the global path.
(`bazelisk` will check the version in `.bazelversion` and use the appropriate bazel version.)

### Generate Bazel files

In order to automatically generate BUILD.bazel files, we implemented a schematic. You can run it with `yarn generate:bazel`.

## Running tests

To run unit tests, run `yarn test <target>`. The `target` can be either a short name (e.g. `yarn test button`) or an explicit path `yarn test src/angular/menu`.
You can also directly use bazel: `bazel test src/...` (to test everything) or `bazel test src/angular/...`
(e.g. to test the angular package) or `bazel test src/angular/button:unit_tests` (e.g. to test the button module).

To run lint, run `yarn lint`.

## Starting showcase

To start the showcase, run `yarn start`. This will run the devserver in watch mode. It might ask
you to allow opening an outgoing port, which would allow you to open the page on another machine in the same network.
