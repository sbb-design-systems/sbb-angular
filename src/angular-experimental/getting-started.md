# Getting Started

**ATTENTION**

This is a collection of experimental modules. They might introduce breaking changes across minor versions
or be removed due to lack of interest or maintenance.

If an experimental module gathers enough interest, it might graduate to a module in `@sbb-esta/angular`.

## Step 0: Prerequisites

You need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/it/) first, and assure yourself to have a working javascript dependency manager like [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/).

Also, we recommend installing the latest Angular CLI globally using the following command:

```sh
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

or using yarn:

```sh
yarn global add @angular/cli
```

You can create now your project as described in the official [Angular CLI documentation](https://cli.angular.io/).

## Step 1: Install the library

### Automatic installation

Just after you created your own Angular project, in order to include the library, you have to run ng add which will take care of the installation and configuration.

```sh
ng add @sbb-esta/angular-experimental
```
