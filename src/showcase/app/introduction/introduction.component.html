<h3>Design Variants</h3>

<h4>Standard (default)</h4>
<p>
  The standard design variant is intended for public websites (e.g. sbb.ch or similar). It uses a
  large amount of whitespace and supports responsive design for mobile, tablet, desktop, 4k and 5k.
  The intended usage of our components in this variant are more limited according to the design
  specification at
  <a href="https://digital.sbb.ch/en/websites">Design System Web</a>.
</p>

<h4>Lean</h4>
<p>
  Lean uses a compact design and supports responsive design for mobile, tablet and desktop. The
  components are more flexible in their usage as specified at
  <a href="https://digital.sbb.ch/en/webapps">Design System Lean Applications</a>.
</p>

<p>
  To activate lean design, set the css class <code>sbb-lean</code> on your
  <code>&lt;html class="sbb-lean"&gt;</code> element.
</p>

<p>If you are uncertain which library to use, we recommend you to start with lean design.</p>
