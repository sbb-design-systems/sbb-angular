  // entering the collapsed content, but children with their own `visibility` can override it.
  // This is a fallback that completely hides the content when the element becomes hidden.
  // Note that we can't do this in the animation definition, because the style gets recomputed too
  // late, breaking the animation because Angular didn't have time to figure out the target height.
  // This can also be achieved with JS, but it has issues when starting an animation before
  // the previous one has finished.
