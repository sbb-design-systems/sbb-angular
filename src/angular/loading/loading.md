The loading component is used as a progress bar to indicate progress and activity, as shown below

```html
<sbb-loading mode="medium" aria-valuetext="Loading, please wait"></sbb-loading>
```

The loading indicator supports four modes (tiny, small, medium (default), big),
a mode for covering the parent element (fullbox),
and a text inline mode, which allows to use the loading indicator within a text and adjust the size to the font size.
